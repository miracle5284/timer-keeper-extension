  Timer Keeper Active does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Your privacy is paramount, and no user-identifiable information is ever recorded.

- **Local Storage Usage:**  
  User settings and preferences (e.g., performance options) are stored locally using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API. This allows your settings to be synchronized across devices without compromising your privacy.

- **No User Tracking:**  
  The extension does not incorporate analytics, tracking pixels, or any external monitoring tools.

- **No Third-Party Data Sharing:**  
  No user data is shared with external servers, APIs, or advertisers. All functionality is self-contained within the extension.

### 2.2 Permissions & Their Purpose

The extension requests the following permissions strictly for its functionality:

| `"tabs"`                     | Interacts with active browser tabs to ensure only the timer website remains active.                         |
| `"scripting"`                | Dynamically injects scripts to enhance performance on target (timer) websites.                              |
| `"idle"`                     | Detects when the user is idle to manage timer activity accordingly.                                         |
| `"cookies"`                  | Reads or modifies cookies for session-based interactions (e.g., to signal that the extension is installed). |
